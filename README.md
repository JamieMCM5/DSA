 Learning data structures and algorithms. 
 - What I've learned so far:
    - Linear Search (arrays)
    - Binary Search (sorted arrays)
    - Bubble Sort (arrays)
    - Combining bubble sort and binary search.
    - Selection Sort, both swapping min and max values to sort an array (arrays)
    - Combining selection sort and binary search.
    - Relearning fundamental knowledge about hashmaps and sets.
    - Learned implementation of the Sliding Window algorithm and different useful applications of it.
    - I learned how to merge arrays together.
    - Combined Binary Search, Selection Sort and merging to process arrays.
    - TODO: Learn how to use Two Pointers.
